## ✨ &nbsp;Remarques / Notes

<!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START -->
- All web projects are either my own idea or my upgraded versions of course projects
- Projects are all hosted with demos
- Hosted demos with .Net back-end take long to load at first because of cloud provider's service
- All projects are with React and .Net 6
